# 4 Digit MWC Media Centre Articles

This is a documentation for 4 Digit MWC Media Centre Workflow via Github.

## Main tools

### Article Writing

For Article Writing, we will use **markdown (.md)** for writing articles. This format is closest to discord message format and easy to use. There are so many applications which support this.

**Recommended Applications**
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) if you are a psychopath

## Workflow

### Github

In order to get access to **Media Centre** and **4dm Repositories** in general, create a [Github](https://github.com/) account, then contact me (HowToPlayLN) with the Github profile link in order to be added into a [4digitmwc Organization](https://github.com/4digitmwc).

### Create Branch

You will see many repositories, but the one we're going to use to write the articles is [media-centre-articles](https://github.com/4digitmwc/media-centre-articles).

Create a separate branch by clicking at the branch icon. The branch name must be in format `yourname/<updates>` (example below)

Then click "Create branch".

### Creating File / Uploading File

After finishing your Article Markdown, go to the folder (stories/interviews/opinions) and upload the file based on category you wrote

For example, if you create a new story, you upload the story by clicking `stories` folder

Then you drop your markdown file or choose from your directory and write a commit message.

Then click **Commit Changes**.

### Pull Requests

After you added new articles or update them, you need to do **Pull Request** for articles to be reviewed. You start by clicking **Pull Requests**.

Then, click **New Pull Request**, then change the `compare:` to your branch (below for example).

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1009839898469089321/unknown.png)

Click **Create Pull Request** and it will bring you to this page

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/546525809440194560/1009840139146641478/unknown.png)

Edit title and description of your Pull Request as you like, then click **Create Pull Request**. Copy the URL and send it to 4dm Media Centre Group Chat.

### Reviews

In order to review a Pull Request from a different author, you click into a Pull Request URL and go to "Files changed", Click "Review Changes" and add your comment

If you think this article still needs changes, click "Comment" or "Request Changes". Or if you think it's ready-to-go click "Approve".

Normally, it's like ranking a map, you need two BNs to approve your map in order to be ranked. This one you need at least two contributors to Approve your pull request in order to merge into the main branch (and ready to be shown).
