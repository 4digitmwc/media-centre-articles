Two thousand years, to be precise, that we had been *wandering through the stars*, through the unidentifiable star clusters, and solar systems. The chance of finding the habitable planet is still the same, regardless of time. The memoryless property of it exponentiates the desperation of the crewmates, as they had been working hard on using the power of immortality. The remaining fuel of this spaceship was getting lower and lower, and there was no resource left for another year. Until there was an alert from a spaceship.

*beep*

This sequence of sine waves brought the attention from everyone in a spacecraft, as it had not been alerted for countless amount of years, and explicitly, 15047 light years we have travelled. All the spacecrews walked through the maze of this megastructure and recruited at the control room...

I opened a terminal, ran a command:

> index@zion\> cat alert.json

```json
{
    "status": 200,
    "content": "Planet found in a scope of 10 light years",
    "algorithm_type": "bfs",
    "planet_data": {
        "name": "ethos-1547b",
        "system": "ethos",
        "sol": {
            "name": "ethos",
            "type": "white-dwarf"
        },
        "sol_distance_au": 0.73,
        "temperature_k": 283.34,
        "atmosphere": {
            "nitrogen": 0.75,
            "oxygen": 0.25,
        },
        "surface": {
            "land": 0.23,
            "water": 0.77
        },
        "gravity": 9.72,
        "rotation_axis": 22.43,
        "tidally_locked": false,
        "habitability": 0.98,
        "distance_from_spaceship_ly": 1.547,
        "eta_days": 40.2
    }
}
```

From the excitement, the coordinators agreed to accelerate the spacecraft.

> index@zion\> python move-spaceship.py --accel

```
Planet Name: ethos-1547b
Changing the target to ethos-1547b...
Expected time arrive: 40.2 days
Expected time arrive (after acceleration): 3 days
```

It took two days for us to see the planet closely, as we are approaching the system *ethos*. The picture ahead of us is the crystal blue, mixed with green shading and the familiar atmosphere to our past home.

The fuel was almost depleted. The robots were sent in order to observe the planet. It was the hit or miss for humanity.

Even though the star was a white dwarf, fortunately, the planet was close enough for us to live, but not too close that it was tidally locked to the star. It was (for some reason) the perfect condition for us mortals.

In a moment, the robots tasks of building the structure for humans to live were completed. It was the time to land our spaceship, and breathe the first exoplanet fresh air.

This was our new little home, as the name *ethos-1547b*, we decided to call it *Zion* to commemorate the spaceship which brought us to this destination.

*ethos-1547b landing completed.*
