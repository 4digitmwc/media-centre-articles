I woke up in my room, in a spaceship, but the anomaly is I couldn't feel anything. I simply felt numb. I opened up my computer and found my leftover binary files which were historical records of humanity before the destruction began. 

As I read through the records, memories of freezing events and pure darkness flooded back into my mind. I discovered the afterlife world... Surprisingly I was alive after the storm of broken glasses hurted me... They were all consequences of what I've done anyway and I deserved it. I shall move on with my life without unnecessary emotion.

The benefit of being emotionless is the ability to do anything and constantly achieve without reaching the brink of exhaustion. But it is all worthless when I can't feel anything from accomplishing anything.

Once again, I sat down at my computer, opened and revised what was written in my favorite notebook and began to perform extended calculations. Within a glance, I began to notice anomalies in the records of humanity. The legends of so-called "Extraterrestrials" among us might be true after all... but how do we define them?

As a person, you can detect Extraterrestrials at the very first glance. But for an emotionless machines like a computer, a notebook or even me myself, it is impossible to distinguish between a single human and an Extraterrestrial. The legends claim that "Extraterrestrials (ET) usually possess an anomaly that allows them to perform tasks better than what humans can imagine". There are so many different ways of defining the performance from the records, namely, the multi-dimensional numerical data with high censoring rate. I attempted to adjust the definition of "outperforming" by highlighting the records which have the high performance scores compared to others. Additionally, it was also important to identify the residences of such crewmates. They apparently lived in places where the population density was low, in seclusion, away from other living beings.

Mashing hard against the keyboard for as long as I could remember, I managed to complete the task. Then I looked at the clock... 2000 years have passed. I began to write the interstellar communication protocol, documenting every detail as understood and analysed of the Extraterrestrials and safety measures to take when encountering them. Walking out of the room, I suddenly felt something... It was an unusual feeling I've never felt for millenia after the destruction.

With the revival of my emotions from the so-called LNCrypted memories, unfortunately, I lost my capability to see the world in colors. As everything seemed to be black and white on my sight. It was so long since I started to inspect those binaries, the 0s and 1s. I started to observe the beauty in the nature of fuzzy logic, but that did not satisfy my emotions at all since I couldn't see the "true essence" of colors.

I would rather continue being emotionless.

The emotional feeling was about to made me think of something. It had been a long time after I thought about the purpose of constructing these enormous cosmic structures. All I knew was, it was for a particular person, and that was where I craved for something with the expectations. As everything went on, and more knowledge acquisition, it was certain for every scenario in the universe that the expectation, comes with the variances, with the least possible outcome ever and wide confidence interval, it was not paid off to pull out these just for someone.

Was it all for everyone? Partially, by partially I mean... it was all for everyone, involving the crewmates I had been working with for millenias. All of these was just for solving the miscommunication between interstellar species, and the classifications of those extraterrestrial among us. But if it was for everyone, why did I isolate myself for over two thousand years just for that?

At last, it was neither for a particular person, nor for everyone, not even for myself. But what I was done was just all because I had a pleasure to do it, I had a pleasure on the consequences after doing it, and I had a pleasure for the outcome from it. As we focused the independent variables only for ourselves, we could control the margin of error and reduce the variance of the expectation. I was confident that, all I did, and all the time and energy I sacrificed, will be paid off.

I needed to find out what happened, and how to deal with my vision, as the "true essence" was out of sight as long as I could remember. Through the uncountable amount of (unidentifiable) stars and galaxies, the cause could not be explicitly found. The last resort was to risk myself and went far from this spaceship for a countless amount of light years, or even trying to find the alternate universe.

No matter how much it cost, even it meant my own life, I could sacrifice all of them just to witness the "true essence" again. 

I looked out the window. The constellations reminded me of my own thoughts, and the method to detect those Extraterrestrial. That made me realized that... According to my own model, I was also one of those Extraterrestrials. It might or might not be accurate but being isolated from people and performed the unbelievables in no time was not the way a normal person behaves, but I was pretty sure that it was just the emotional loss which provided me this kind of freedom to do anything I wanted.

[The part after this is still wip]

As I could find the correlation between two species, I also had some abilities to connect between two worlds. The depth first search and the linking inbetween the stars, the processing result was, it was too late to resurrect the "true essence" again. I decided to leave the spaceship and floated away to somewhere thousand light years away, *wandering through the stars*, it took a linear time to discover the leftover energy from the disintegration of the "true essence". I realized that... I might have enough power to recover that, and for the humanity to be able to see the colors again. But the tradeoff was... my own life. It was surely a commitment that someone needed to desolate themselves for the humanity. But at all, I thought it was a really fair and profitable trade. I was willing to sacrifice my life, and all of my power just to save the humanity.

I closed my eyes, there surely was no turning back from here... As I connected myself to the other universe, I was able to see the colors again, and heard the usual speech... The *Essence*, of all the incidents happened on the Earth and other planets. As I opened my eyes up, the brightness of the constellations were clear, and the chaos had been detected. There was no time left and I was ready to pay everything.
